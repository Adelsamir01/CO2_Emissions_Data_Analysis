### CO2 Emissions Dataset Analysis and Visualization

Provided that the datasets were cleaned and needed no further cleaning, the three datasets were combined together using the common primary keys in each dataset. This step was done after refining and renaming the matching keys together. After that, the unnecessary columns in the datasets were dropped.

In order to understand the dataset, we need to fetch global insights. Then, to get a deeper analytical view for the dataset, I went further and focused on the subsets. Then, the subsets were compared to fetch insightful information about the dataset. 

Finally, various visualizations were done (Static and Interactive).

Attached here are four files: 
- Working Jupyter Notebook with all implemented code.
- HTML Report for the code.
- Detailed and descriptive Word file.
- Combined Cleaned Dataset.
